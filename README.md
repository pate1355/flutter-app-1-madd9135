# Basic Flutter App Assignment

This Flutter app demonstrates a basic layout with a single scrollable screen that integrates local and remote assets, custom fonts, and multiple widgets. The app is designed as per the assignment requirements.

## Features

- **Custom Fonts**:

  - The app uses the **Hind Siliguri** font family with three variants: Regular, Bold, and Light.
  - Fonts are integrated locally and applied to `ListTile` widgets with specific styles.

- **Images**:

  - **Local Images**: Four images are stored in the `assets/images` folder and displayed in a horizontal scrollable `ListView`.
  - **Remote Images**: Four images are loaded via URLs and displayed in another horizontal scrollable `ListView`.

- **Layout**:
  - A vertical `ListView` serves as the main container for the content.
  - Two horizontal `ListView` widgets display local and remote images.
  - Four `ListTile` widgets demonstrate the usage of different font styles and include leading/trailing icons.
